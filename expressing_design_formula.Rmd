# Expressing experimental designs using R formula

In this module, we will show how to use the two base R functions

- `formula`
- `model.matrix`

in order to produce *design matrices* (also known as *model matrices*) for a variety of linear models. 

The choice of design matrix is a critical step in linear modeling as it encodes which coefficients will be fit in the model, and the inter-relationship between the samples. 

The very simplest design matrix is a column of 1's, where a single coefficient is fit for all the samples, called the *Intercept*. For standard linear modeling, this fitted coefficient will just be the average of the `y` values, e.g., the log expression values for all samples.

However, the design matrices we typically work with have at least two columns: an intercept column as before which consists of a column of 1's, and a second column which species which samples are in a second group. In this case, two coefficients are fit in the linear model: the intercept, which captures the base level of the first group, and a second coefficient which captures the difference between the second group and the first group. This is typically the coefficient we are interested in for performing statistical testing: we want to know if difference between the two groups is zero or not. 

We encode this experimental design in R by first specifying a variable which tells us which samples are in which group, and then using the 'tilde' symbol, `~`, to say that the y values should be modeled using this variable.

Suppose we have two groups, 1 and 2, with two samples each. We might start to encode this experimental design like so:


```{r}
x <- c(1,1,2,2)
f <- formula(~ x)
f
```

Note that an intercept will be included by default, so the formula could equivalently be written: `~ x + 1`.

We can then inspect the design matrix which is formed by this:

```{r}
model.matrix(f)
```

Note, this is not the design matrix we wanted, and the reason is that we provided a numeric variable to the `formula` and `model.matrix` functions, without saying that these numbers actually referred to different groups.

We should instead first tell R that these values should not be interpreted numerically, but as different levels of a factor variable:

```{r}
x <- factor(c(1,1,2,2))
model.matrix(~ x)
```

Now we have achieved the correct design matrix.

## More groups

Here we show the design matrix for an experiment with three groups:

```{r}
x <- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,3))
model.matrix(~ x)
```

Now we have a third column which specifies which samples belong to the third group.

An alternate formulation of design matrix is possible by specifying `+ 0` in the  formula:

```{r}
x <- factor(c(1,1,2,2,3,3))
model.matrix(~ x + 0)
```

This group now fits a separate coefficient for each group. In order to compare the levels to each other, we need to use some additional steps, which is called the construction of contrasts. These are covered in the `limma` package vignette for microarray analysis with multiple groups.

## More variables

We can simply add additional variables with a `+` sign, in order to build a design matrix which fits based on the information in additional variables:

```{r}
x <- factor(c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2))
y <- factor(c("a","a","b","b","a","a","b","b"))
model.matrix(~ x + y)
```

We could say that this linear model accounts for differences in both the x and y variables.

We assume in the above model specification, that the effect of the x and y variables are simply additive. Being in group 2 and group b is equal to the difference between 2 and 1 and the difference between b and a. 

Another model is possible which fits and additional term, which encodes the potential interaction of x and y variables. This can be written in either of the following two formula:

```{r}
model.matrix(~ x + y + x:y)
model.matrix(~ x*y)
```

## Releveling

The level which is chosen for the *base level*, i.e., the level which is contrasted against, is simply the first level alphabetically. We can specify that we want group 2 to be the base level by either using the `relevel` function, or by providing the levels explicitly in the `factor` call:

```{r}
x <- factor(c(1,1,2,2))
model.matrix(~ x)
x <- relevel(x,"2")
model.matrix(~ x)
x <- factor(x, levels=c("1","2"))
```

## Numeric variables

In the beginning of this lab, we assumed that we didn't want to encode the  variable as a numeric, but in certain designs we might be interested in using numeric variables in the design formula, not converting them to a factor first. For example, we could be interested in testing various dosage of a treatment, where we expect a  specific relationship between log gene expression and the dosage, e.g. 0 mg, 10mg, 20mg. Here we show how to encode a numeric variable: a linear model with an intercept, without an intercept, and additionally as a quadratic relationship.

```{r}
z <- 1:4
model.matrix(~ z)
model.matrix(~ 0 + z)
model.matrix(~ z + I(z^2))
```

The `I` function above is necessary to specify a mathematical transformation of a variable. See `?I` for more information.

## Where does model.matrix look for the data

Finally, notice that the `model.matrix` function will grab the variable from the R environment, unless the data is explicitly provided in the `data` argument:

```{r}
x <- 1:4
model.matrix(~ x)
model.matrix(~ x, data=data.frame(x=5:8))
```
